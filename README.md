### Me 
I transitioned from the hospitality industry to pursue my passion for programming, embracing web development with a strong focus on clean architecture, scalability, and best practices.

My approach to development is structured yet adaptable, ensuring that every solution I build is maintainable, efficient, and user-focused. Whether working on e-commerce platforms, custom modules, or high-performance APIs, I prioritize clarity in design, performance optimization, and adherence to industry standards.
